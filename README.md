# osu-wine.nix

This is a version of Wine that uses wine-staging patches as well as some
other patches that are intended for making the osu! experience better. I
moved this out from my dotfiles because the amount of patches has
changed my dotfiles' language displayed in GitHub to "C".

Note that this is *only* meant to be used for osu!, the Wine version may
be severely outdated, have security vulnerabilities, etc etc. I may
update this once or twice a year, but no promises.
